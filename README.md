Hi there! I'm Moamel ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Flutter App Developer with over two years of expertise in building high-quality, cross-platform mobile applications. I specialize in UI/UX design, robust API integration, and implementing efficient state management to deliver scalable and user-friendly solutions.


I'm committed to solving complex problems and constantly improving my technical skills to stay ahead of industry trends.

My apologies! That's frustrating. If you copied the Markdown table and it didn't render correctly on GitHub, it usually means there was a small typo, or you might be viewing the raw file instead of the rendered profile page.

However, since you're having trouble with the table syntax, let's fix this by using normal, easy-to-read text formatting instead of a table. This ensures it looks clean no matter where it's pasted.

Here is the revised code block for your "Technical Toolkit" section, using bolding and clear formatting:

## ðŸ’» My Technical Toolkit
I focus on best practices to build reliable and maintainable applications.

Core Technology Stack
Framework: Flutter â€” Cross-platform mobile development (Android/iOS).

Backend: Firebase â€” Authentication, Firestore (NoSQL database), Cloud Storage.

Development Disciplines
Data & Logic: State Management â€” Managing complex application state (e.g., cart data, user roles).

Connectivity: API Integration â€” Handling asynchronous data and integrating with RESTful APIs.

Workflow: Git â€” Professional version control with branching, merging, and collaboration.

Design: UI/UX Design â€” Creating intuitive, user-friendly, and modern app interfaces.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects & Technical Achievements
These projects demonstrate my ability to tackle complex architectural challenges and deliver polished, real-world applications.

1. Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

Achievement: Designed and developed a full-stack, multi-role e-commerce application that supports two distinct user types (Customers and Vendors) within a single platform.


Tech Stack Focus: Implemented a serverless backend using Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage), securing data access with role-based rules to separate Customer and Vendor data.


Features: Engineered core functions including categorization and filtering (Men/Women/Kids), a persistent shopping cart system, dedicated Vendor Dashboards for product management (CRUD), and a streamlined dual sign-in.

2. Mini-Social
Built a real-time chat application using Firebase and state management, focusing on real-time data updates and seamless user interaction.

3. My Cafe
Created a dynamic cafe app to gain hands-on experience with advanced state management and handling dynamic data within a commercial-style application.

## ðŸ“ˆ Soft Skills & Approach
I apply a critical and organized approach to my work:

Problem Solving: Addressing complex challenges related to data synchronization and business logic.

Analyzing Skills: Designing logical database structures and security rules based on app requirements.


Attention to Detail: Ensuring pixel-perfect UI/UX and rigorous data integrity.
